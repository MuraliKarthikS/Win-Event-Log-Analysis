# üõ°Ô∏è Windows Event Log Parser ‚Äì Brute Force Detection

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates how to parse **Windows Security Event Logs (.evtx)** using Python to detect failed logon attempts (**Event ID 4625**) and identify potential brute-force login attacks.  

It simulates a SOC (Security Operations Center) workflow:
1. Collect Windows Security logs (`.evtx`)
2. Parse and extract failed login details (user, source IP, process, reason)
3. Detect brute force patterns (top offending IPs, most targeted users)
4. Export structured results to CSV for reporting

##  Features
- Parses `.evtx` logs with [python-evtx](https://github.com/williballenthin/python-evtx)  
- Extracts key fields:  
  - Time of event  
  - Target user  
  - Source IP address  
  - Process name  
  - Failure reason  
- Frequency analysis:  
  - Top offending IPs  
  - Most targeted user accounts  
- Export results to **CSV** for SOC reports

##  Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install python-evtx lxml
